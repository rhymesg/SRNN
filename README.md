# SRNN
Pytorch implementation of structural recurrent neural network (SRNN) for traffic speed prediction.

Built with Python 3.5

- Scalable learning of the interaction between adjacent road segments and the temporal dynamics
- Able to predict traffic speed of road networks different from the network used to train
- Outperforms the image-based approaches using the CapsNet and CNN, requiring the smaller, constant number of parameters to train
